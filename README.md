# osteoporosis-risk-prediction-
Technologies Used: Python, Machine Learning, Database Management, Front-End Development
Description: Built a predictive system to assess osteoporosis risk based on patient data such as age, BMI, and medical history. Implemented machine learning algorithms for risk analysis and integrated a database for storing patient records and predictions. Developed a user-friendly interface for seamless data input and visualization, supporting early diagnosis and preventative care.
