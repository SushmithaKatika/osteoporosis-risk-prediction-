            Osteoporosis is a common condition that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break. It can develop over several years, often going unnoticed until a minor fall or sudden impact causes a fracture. The risk of developing osteoporosis increases with age, especially in postmenopausal women.

            This app is designed to help individuals assess their risk of osteoporosis by analyzing key factors such as age, gender, calcium intake, and bone density. By providing early risk predictions, this tool empowers users to take preventive steps, consult healthcare professionals, and improve bone health through lifestyle changes and medication.
